## Overview
I design and develop a **Doctors Directory Page**. The goal is to create a clean, user-friendly interface that allows users to find doctors based on their specialty and optionally by location.

## Features
- **Doctor Directory**: Displays a list of doctors categorized by specialty.
- **Filtering System**: Users can filter doctors by specialty and location.
- **Doctor Information Display**:
  - Name
  - Specialty
  - Location
  - Profile Picture (or placeholder)
  - Short description (qualifications, clinic timings, etc.)
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Hover effects for additional information (e.g., contact details).
  - Dynamic UI to reflect selected filters.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Optional Enhancements**:
  - Map view displaying doctor locations.
  - Ratings and reviews for doctors.
  - Scheduling or availability options.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Core frontend technologies)
- **React.js** (Optional for dynamic UI handling)
- **Tailwind CSS** (For styling and responsiveness)
- **Icons** (FontAwesome, Material Icons, or any suitable library)
